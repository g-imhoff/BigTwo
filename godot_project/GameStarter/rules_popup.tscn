Objective
Be the first to play all your cards by beating your opponents' combos.

Card Deal
Each player gets 13 cards from a 52-card deck (no jokers).

How to Play

The player with the 3♦ starts.

Turns go clockwise.

On your turn, play a stronger combo or pass.

If everyone passes, the last player who played starts a new round.

Cards per Turn

The first play decides how many cards must be played that round.

Example: If a pair is played, only stronger pairs can follow.

Valid Combos

Single (e.g. K♠)

Pair (e.g. 7♦ 7♣)

Three-of-a-kind (e.g. 5♠ 5♦ 5♥)

Straight (5 cards in a row)

Flush (5 cards, same suit)

Full House (3 of a kind + a pair)

Four-of-a-kind + 1 extra

Straight Flush (5 in a row, same suit)

Winning
The first player to play all their cards wins!

Card Strength

Card Rank: 2 > A > K > Q > J > 10 > ... > 3

Suit Order: ♠ > ♥ > ♣ > ♦

Tip
Play smart combos to block others and empty your hand faster! 🚀"
