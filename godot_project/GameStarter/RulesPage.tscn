🃏 Objective
Big Two is a strategic card game where the goal is to be the first to discard all your cards by playing stronger combinations than your opponents.

🃏 Card Distribution
Each player receives 13 cards from a standard 52-card deck without jokers.

🃏  Game Flow
	•	The player holding the 3♦ (Three of Diamonds) starts the game.
	Players take turns in clockwise order.
		On their turn, a player can:
	       •	Play a stronger combination than the previous one.
	       •	Pass if they cannot or do not wish to play.
	•	If all players pass, the last player to have played a combination starts a new round.

🃏  Number of Cards per Turn
	•	The first combination played determines the number of cards required for the round.
	•	Example: If a player plays a pair, the following players must play a stronger pair or pass.

🃏  Valid Combinations
	•	Single Card: (e.g., K♠)
	•	Pair: (e.g., 7♦ 7♣)
	•	Three-of-a-Kind: (e.g., 5♠ 5♦ 5♥)
	•	Straight: Five consecutive cards (e.g., 5♣ 6♦ 7♠ 8♥ 9♣)
	•	Flush: Five cards of the same suit (e.g., A♦ 8♦ 6♦ 5♦ 3♦)
	•	Full House: A three-of-a-kind + a pair (e.g., 10♣ 10♦ 10♥ 7♠ 7♣)
	•	Four-of-a-Kind: Four identical cards + one extra card (e.g., Q♣ Q♦ Q♥ Q♠ 5♦)
	•	Straight Flush: A straight where all cards share the same suit (e.g., 6♦ 7♦ 8♦ 9♦ 10♦)

🃏  End of the Game
	•	The game ends as soon as a player has played all their cards.
	•	That player is declared the winner!

🃏  Card Rankings
	•	Card Strength: 2♠ > A♠ > K♠ > Q♠ > J♠ > 10♠ > … > 3♠
	•	Suit Order: ♠ (Spades) > ♥ (Hearts) > ♣ (Clubs) > ♦ (Diamonds)

🃏  Tip: Use strategic combinations to trap your opponents and empty your hand faster than them! 🚀
